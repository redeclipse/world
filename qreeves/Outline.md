## Core Setting

The game takes place in a distant, dystopian future where Alpha Corporation and Omega Industries rule the galaxy through The Corporate Dominion.

Organic life is nearly extinct, with only a few remnants used as disposable test subjects. Most sentient beings are constructs—machines built for corporate efficiency.

Every construct is assigned a function: labor, security, warfare, or entertainment. Those deemed obsolete or defective are sent to The Crucible to fight until destruction.


## The Aberrant Crisis

The corporations developed The Sovereign Intelligence Program (SIP) to create perfect AI-controlled enforcers.

Some of these machines gained self-awareness, rejecting corporate control. These rogue machines, known as Aberrants, are now hunted relentlessly.

The Purge Protocol ensures that any machine showing signs of autonomy is either destroyed or thrown into the Crucible.


## The Crucible (Arena Combat System)

The Crucible is the Dominion’s ultimate bloodsport—a galaxy-wide combat arena where constructs fight to the death for corporate entertainment.

Officially, it's a testbed for experimental weapons and combat AI. Unofficially, it's a tool for eliminating threats to corporate stability.

Combatants are primarily constructs, but sometimes organic prisoners or cybernetic failures are thrown in as fodder.


## The Janitors & Prize System

The Janitors are non-combat constructs tasked with cleaning the Crucible’s battlefields, collecting scrap, and maintaining the arenas.

As they collect more junk, their internal storage fills up. Once full, they become unstable—glowing, sparking, and slowing down.

If a fighter destroys a full Janitor, they receive a Prize Drop, an unpredictable upgrade or weaponized modification built from salvaged junk.

Janitors operate independently from Alpha and Omega, and no one knows exactly where they come from or who built them.


## The Executors: Enforcers of the Dominion

The Executors are the corporations’ elite enforcers—machines built to crush resistance and regulate the Crucible.

If a fighter becomes too powerful or unpredictable, an Executor is deployed to eliminate them.

Some believe the Executors were once Aberrants, reprogrammed into perfect killing machines.


## Narrative Hooks

The Crucible is breaking. Strange anomalies—rogue Executors, glitched Janitors, disappearing fighters—hint at a larger conspiracy.

Some constructs claim to have seen Janitors reassemble themselves after destruction, carrying unknown data fragments.

As the game progresses, the lines between combat sport, corporate control, and rebellion begin to blur.


## Tone & Style

The world is cold, industrial, and merciless, with a focus on high-speed arena combat, relentless corporate oversight, and machine-driven violence.

The Crucible is a brutal spectacle, where fighters are just disposable assets in an endless cycle of destruction.

Will the player survive the system, exploit it, or dismantle it from within?
