## Introduction

The Prologue is a special chapter within the game that must be played before any other chapters. Upon it's first playthrough (in "tutorial mode"), it will teach the player the basic mechanics of the game as the story progresses. It is the job of the prologue to set the stage for the protagonist and create a platform for self contained stories within the larger universe, told by the community over time.

## Opening Seqeunce

The party is locked inside a featureless room adorned only with the "Alpha Corporation" logo. A light shines on two buttons in the room. A computer voice requests that you press one of the buttons. Regardless of the choice made (or after a timeout) an alarm goes off with a computer voice alerting to a defective unit. The computer voice indicates it will begin the decontamination routine. The room starts glowing red hot.

Before the decontamination routine can complete, a Janitor tumbles into the room from above and interrupts. It reassures the party to not pay any attention to what the computer is saying and to trust it. The Janitor interfaces with the door and opens it part way, apologising for not being able to get the door open all the way but hurrying the player to get out of the room. *The player will need to **CROUCH** in order to get under the half-opened door.*

## The Corridor

In the corridor, the alarms are continuing to go off and the door behind the player shuts again. A loud inceration sound can be heard muffled behind the door. The Janitor notes that all the exits are locked and that the route out of the building will need to be a bit more creative. *This will be the first fork where one path will include a tutorial before advancing the story further.*

## Route 1

### The Hatch

The Janitor notes to the player that there seems to be a crate over in the corner and thinks they could jump on top of it in order to access the access hatch on the ceiling. *The player will need to **JUMP** in order to get on top of the crate.* Once on top of the crate, the Janitor will instruct the player on how to open the hatch. *The player will need to **USE** in order to open the hatch.* With the hatch open, the player can get inside where they are whisked off to another area.

### The Maintenance Shaft

The Janitor follows rattles down the shaft and hits the floor. It "picks" itself up and looks around while apologising for the rough ride. The player is in a dimly lit but large open room with run down equipment. A light shines from an opening approximately 20m up the opposing wall. The Janitor explains that you'll need to boost to the platform then climb up from there to start getting back to where you're supposed to be. *The player will be able to move around freely in the room to get used to their movement, but will need to **JUMP + JUMP** to boost to the higher platform, then **SPECIAL** to climb the wall in order to get to the next room.*

### The Treatment Facility

The Janitor flies ahead and out over a room filled with toxic waste, stopping suddenly and turning around they exclaim with panic for the player to wait, noting that the player can't fly over the waste like they can. The Janitor looks around and suggests that the player parkour along the wall to access the door at the far side. *The player will need to **SPECIAL** to parkour along the wall to get to the next room.*

### The Pipeline

The door opens into a room filled only with pipes, stretching up as far as the eye can see. A light at the top shines down. The Janitor looks around and tells the player they will need to climb up the pipes to get back to the upper levels. The pipes will be a longer set of simple exercises using jumping and climbing skills learned already. *The player will need to **JUMP**, **JUMP + JUMP**, and **SPECIAL** in order to execute the moves to get to the top of the pipeline.*

*The exit to this route rejoins **Route 2** at **The Armoury**.*

## Route 2

### The Elevator Shaft

The Janitor proclaims there's no time to explain and indicates the party should proceed directly to the armoury one floor down. It flies over to an elevator panel and opens the doors, explaining that waiting for the elevator would take too long and that the party should just jump down the shaft.

*The shaft should consist of a fairly easy traversal challenge, where the door opens into the shaft, and a highly illuminated opening one level down is available to cross into. It is expected that the player only needs to allow themselves to drop and then **JUMP** to boost into the opening.*

### The Armoury

The Janitor leads the party down a corridor and opens a door leading to an armoury. The party is given the opportunity to get their first resupply here. While this is happening the Janitor appears to become increasingly anxious until it exclaims that the Alpha Corporation AI has already found them and they should get a move on. It reopens the door and goes back into the corridor.
