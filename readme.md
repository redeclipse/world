## World Repository

This is a place for artists working on the world, story, and lore of Red Eclipse to
collaborate in a private space and refine the story that eventually gets shown to
the public.

Access to this repository is restricted, if a team member requires access please
notify @qreeves

### Contributing

It is best if contributors create their own folder in this repository and organise
their work there. How you do so from there is up to you.
